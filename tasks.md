# Project-Level Priority Tasks

1. **Planner backlog & release readiness sync**
   - Turn the 8-week roadmap into sprint-ready deliverables with explicit owners and blockers.
   - Keep release/QA criteria aligned with strategist expectations and developer outputs.

2. **Tech architect spec & reliability controls**
   - Keep the launch architecture spec current (Supabase, optional API, monitoring, data domains) and document environment requirements/automation for seeds or backups.
   - Track security/reliability gaps and validate the seeded catalog/sync strategies with the dev team.

3. **Strategist ROI & decision guardrails**
   - Refresh phase-based cost/hosting assumptions when MAU/architecture shifts, capture monetization hypotheses, and define Phase 1 vs paid-launch go/no-go criteria.
   - Coordinate weekly priorities with the planner so strategy remains reflected in the backlog.

4. **Researcher evidence & benchmarks**
   - Gather market intel on fitness/social products, surface technical unknowns (Supabase limits, RevenueCat quirks), and compile customer/usage questions or benchmarks that inform strategy and architecture.

5. **Software dev docs & QA alignment**
   - Keep `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `FT-DEV.md` updated with the latest UI flows, sensors, and tooling.
   - Collaborate with the architect to validate seeded catalog/sync strategies.
   - Maintain QA checklists per sprint for planner/manager sign-off.
