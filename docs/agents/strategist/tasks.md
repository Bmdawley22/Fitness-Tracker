# Strategist Tasks

1. Refresh the phase-based cost/hosting plan from `Fitness-Tracker-Roadmap.md` whenever the architecture or MAU assumptions shift.
2. Capture monetization hypotheses (pricing, conversion, retention) tied to the roadmap phases and note any new data needed to validate them.
3. Define go/no-go criteria for Phase 1 vs paid launch, and keep those visible for planning/tech stakeholders.
4. Coordinate with the planner on weekly priorities so strategic goals stay reflected in the sprint backlog.
