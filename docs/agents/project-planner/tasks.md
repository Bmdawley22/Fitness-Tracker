# Planner Tasks

1. Translate the roadmap’s 8-week execution plan into a sprint backlog with explicit deliverables and owners.
2. Capture dependencies and blockers (e.g., supabase config, RevenueCat mapping) so the team can sequence work safely.
3. Keep release readiness criteria (QA checklist, builds, store metadata) aligned with the planner and strategist priorities.
4. Update this list after each planning cycle so the strategist and dev agent can see what comes next.
