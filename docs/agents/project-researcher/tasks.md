# Researcher Tasks

0. **Highest priority:** Evaluate the current UI state of the Fitness Tracker app, research UI makeover ideas or best practices that would elevate the experience, and report concrete suggestions/patterns back here per the binding instructions from Brady.
1. Gather fresh market intel on fitness/social apps that align with the fitness tracker’s value props and note differentiators.
2. Track technology research needs (supabase limits, data sync trade-offs, RevenueCat quirks) and surface them before sprint planning.
3. Compile customer/usage questions that need experimentation or validation before Phase 2, and map owners for follow-up.
4. Curate any benchmarks or analytics targets that can inform the strategist and architect decisions.
