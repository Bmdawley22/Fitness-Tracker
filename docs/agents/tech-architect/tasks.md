# Tech Architect Tasks

1. Keep the Launch Architecture spec current with any infra or data model changes (Supabase + optional API, storage, monitoring).
2. Document environment requirements (dev/staging/prod) and any automation needed for deployments or seeds.
3. Track security/reliability controls (RLS, backups, alerts) and note implementation gaps before each phase.
4. Surface any architectural decisions to the strategist/planner so they can reflect them in roadmaps and tolerances.
