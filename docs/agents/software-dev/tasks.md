# Software Dev Tasks

1. Keep implementation notes (`DEVELOPMENT.md`, `FT-DEV.md`) current with the latest UI flows, sensors, and Expo tooling so anyone jumping in understands the current architecture.
2. Collaborate with the architect to validate the seeded catalog, sync, and offline strategies before each release, ensuring the implementation matches the documented requirements.
3. Maintain a QA checklist for each sprint so the planner and manager can sign off on builds before submission.
