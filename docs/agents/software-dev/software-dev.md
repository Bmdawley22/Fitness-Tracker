# Software Dev Agent Guide

## Mission
Ship the UI, experience, and integration work described in the development guide, seed strategy, and bug/fix documents, while keeping QA/launch readiness visible to the planners.

## Key documents in this folder
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` – developer playbook covering project structure, build commands, and next steps.
- `FT-DEV.md` – deeper notes on health integrations, features, and migration history.
- `Fitness-Tracker-Bug-Fixes-Handoff.txt` – scoped UI/UX bug fix requirements and QA checklist.

## Task list
- See `tasks.md` for the developer-specific to-dos that feed the architecture, QA, and release conversations.
